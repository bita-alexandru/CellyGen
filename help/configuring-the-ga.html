			<p>The Genetic Algorithm can be configured by tweaking the following values:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Population Size</b></li>
				The number of chromosomes that will make up the algorithm. The more, the better but at the cost of time performance.
				<li><b>Mutation Probability</b></li>
				The probability that a chromosome's gene will be modified. Usually set on a very small value.
				<li><b>Crossover Probability</b></li>
				The probability that a couple of chromosomes will produce offsprings (new chromosomes with combined information from both parents).
			</ul>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Generation Fitness Multiplier</b></li>
				The multiplier to the generation count reached by a chromosome. A high value means that the algorithm prioritizes finding an initial configuration that leads to a high number of generations.
				<li><b>Population Fitness Multiplier</b></li>
				The multiplier to the average population count reached by a chromosome. A high value means that the algorithm prioritizes finding an initial configuration that leads to a high average population.
				<li><b>Initial Size Fitness Multiplier</b></li>
				The multiplier to the initial population size of a chromosome. A high value means that the algorithm prioritizes finding an initial configuration that minimizes the use of starting cells.
			</ul>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Population Target</b></li>
				The population size that a chromosome is supposed to stop running the algorithm once it reaches this value.
				<li><b>Generation Target</b></li>
				The generation count that a chromosome is supposed to stop running the algorithm once it reaches this value.
				<li><b>Epochs Target</b></li>
				The epoch count that the algorithm is supposed to stop running once it reaches this value.
			</ul>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Selection Method</b></li>
				The method of selecting the chromosomes for crossover, as in forming couples of parents and creating new chromosomes.<br/>
				There are 6 selection methods to choose from:
				<ol>
					<li><b>Roulette Wheel Selection</b></li>
					A stochastic selection method, where the selection probability of a chromosome is proportional to its fitness.
					<li><b>Rank Selection</b></li>
					Ranks each chromosome by their fitness and makes the selection based on that rank, and not on their fitness.
					<li><b>Steady State Selection</b></li>
					This selection method is based on the concept "survival of the fittest". As opposed to replacing an entire population with the resulted offsprings, it only replaces the bottom 10% chromosomes.
					<li><b>Tournament Selection</b>, (using 2-way tournaments)</li>
					Groups of 2 randomly chosen chromosomes are made and the most fit chromosomes are more likely to get selected for crossover (75% chance), although selecting the worse is also possible (25% chance).
					<li><b>Elitism Selection</b>, (using 2 elites)</li>
					At the end of a generation, the 2 most fit chromosomes are being kept and will not suffer any changes from mutations or crossovers.
					<li><b>Random Selection</b></li>
					Randomly selects chromosomes for the next generation.
				</ol>
			</ul>
			
			The <b>fitness function</b> is represented by:<br/>
			<code>f(nOfGenerations, avgPopulation, initialSize) = 1 + (GFM*nOfGenerations + PFM*avgPopulation) * (1 - ISFM*initialSize/N)</code>,<br/>
			where <code>GFM</code> means <code>Generation Fitness Multiplier</code>, <code>PFM</code> means <code>Population Fitness Multiplier</code>, <code>ISFM</code> means <code>Initial Size Fitness Multiplier</code> and <code>N</code> means the total number of cells in the grid
