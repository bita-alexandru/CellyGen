		<h2>What is CellyGen</h2>
		<p>CellyGen is an application designed to explore <i>Cellular Automata</i> (CA).<br/>
		You can play around and experiment with various Cellular Automata by tweaking the states and the rules in the corresponding panels and by drawing different patterns on the grid.<br/>
		The program features a customizable <i>Genetic Algorithm</i> (GA) that is meant to assist in finding initial patterns that lead to interesting and complex results over the course of the simulation.</p> 
		
		<h2>What are Cellular Automata</h2>
		<p>A cellular automaton (pl. cellular automata, CA) is a collection of "colored" cells on a grid of specified shape that evolves through a number of discrete time steps according to a set of <i>rules</i> based on the <i>states</i> of <i>neighboring</i> cells. The rules are then applied iteratively for as many time steps as desired.<sup>[1]</sup></p>
		
		<h2>What are Genetic Algorithms</h2>
		<p>A genetic algorithm (GA) is a search heuristic that is inspired by Charles Darwinâ€™s theory of natural evolution. This algorithm reflects the process of natural selection where the fittest individuals are selected for reproduction in order to produce offspring of the next generation.<sup>[2]</sup></p>
